My first post using `@narative/gatsby-theme-novela`. Novela is built by the team at [Narative](https://narative.co), and built for everyone that loves the web. The tech stack is built with [gatsbyjs](https://gatsbyjs.com) using [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web). The attempt here is to create cross platform code examples using React Native code that can be visible on ios/android and web.


Thanks for stopping by.
